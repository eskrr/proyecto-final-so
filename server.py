#This sample program, based on the one in the standard library documentation, receives incoming messages and echos them back to the sender. It starts by creating a TCP/IP socket.

import socket
import sys
import time

# Create a TCP/IP socket
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_STREAM)

#Then bind() is used to associate the socket with the server address. In this case, the address is localhost, referring to the current server, and the port number is 10000.

# Bind the socket to the port
server_address = ('localhost', 10000)
print >>sys.stderr, 'starting up on %s port %s' % server_address
sock.bind(server_address)

#Calling listen() puts the socket into server mode, and accept() waits for an incoming connection.

# Listen for incoming connections
sock.listen(1)


# Wait for a connection
print >>sys.stderr, 'waiting for a connection'
connection, client_address = sock.accept()

#accept() returns an open connection between the server and client, along with the address of the client. The connection is actually a different socket on another port (assigned by the kernel). Data is read from the connection with recv() and transmitted with sendall().

try:
  print >>sys.stderr, 'connection from', client_address

    # Receive the data 
  while True:   
    data = connection.recv(256)
    print >>sys.stderr, 'server received "%s"' % data
    if data:
      print >>sys.stderr, 'sending answer back to the client'
  
      connection.sendall('va de regreso...' + data)
    else:
      print >>sys.stderr, 'no data from', client_address
      connection.close()
      sys.exit()
      
finally:
     # Clean up the connection
  print >>sys.stderr, 'se fue al finally'
  connection.close()

#When communication with a client is finished, the connection needs to be cleaned up using close(). This example uses a try:finally block to ensure that close() is always called, even in the event of an error.
